#summary
The goal of the project was to create a program that would teach students the concepts of fiscal responsibility, specifically on investing and the power of compound interest. The program allowed users to see how their investments would grow over time.

#what I did well
I think I did particularly well with the Header.h file. I enjoy making classes and it was not very hard to set up.

#what I can improve
I'm not entirely sure on what I can improve, as I was not able to get any feedback because I could not figure out how to create a zip file. 

#Most challenging
The most challenging part was creating the menu screen and figuring out how many asterisks to use and working out spacing issues. I just took my time and tried to map it out as evenly as possible. I also reached out to friends to see if they had any ideas on how to make it easier on myself.

#transferabel skills
I think I learned how to properly write a try and catch code during this project. I think that skill will be particularly helpful in writing game code, as you dont want the game to crash everytime an error occurs.
